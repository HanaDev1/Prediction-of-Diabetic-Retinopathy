# Prediction of Diabetic Retinopathy
Diabetic retinopathy is among the most dangerous diabetic complications, can leading to lifelong blindness if left untreated. This research intends to Diabetic retinopathy detection and classification to stages using retina images by applying Conventional neural network and transfer learning models Which are InceptionV3 and EfficientNetsB5. The evaluation performance of models based on Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, confusion matrix, and kappa.

# Dataset
The APTOS 2019 blindness detection dataset used in this research.  It contains a large set of retina images taken using fundus photography, to conduct some experiments through various models of deep and transfer learning. The Asia Pacific Tele-Ophthalmology Society (APTOS) published this dataset in the second quarter of 2019.
